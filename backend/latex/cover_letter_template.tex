% Salutation
Dear Hiring Manager,

% Body paragraphs
I am excited to apply for the Full Stack Development Intern position at Mauka Digital. I recently completed my Computer Science degree at Arizona State University and I have a strong background in full stack development, frontend design, and modern web technologies. I enjoy building clean, fast, and scalable digital experiences, which aligns closely with Mauka Digital's mission to innovate and push the boundaries of traditional marketing.

In my current roles at Fitkind LLC and Career Compass AI, I build production-ready features, design and improve user-facing interfaces, refactor existing code, and work across both frontend and backend systems. My experience includes React, JavaScript, PHP, Python, WordPress, SQL, and cloud-based environments. I have also worked on projects involving CMS platforms, API integrations, and performance testing, along with research and evaluation of tools, themes, and frameworks for different builds. I enjoy improving existing systems, refining code quality, and contributing to projects that demand both creativity and technical depth.

Mauka Digital's focus on custom solutions and its commitment to creativity and innovation inspires me. I would love the opportunity to contribute to your team, learn from experienced developers, and help build high-quality digital experiences that support your clients and vision.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the chance to contribute to Mauka Digital.
